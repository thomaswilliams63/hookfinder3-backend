1. Update frontend to remove API key input and fetch from env
2. In 'src/App.tsx' or wherever the API call is made, replace user-input OpenAI key with a secure call to your server
3. In Netlify backend, store your key in a serverless function's .env file

Example Cursor fix:
--- FRONTEND (App.tsx) ---
// Remove the OpenAI key input UI block entirely

--- BACKEND (functions/process-youtube.ts or wherever API is called) ---
// Use process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY
const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY });

--- .env ---
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

--- netlify.toml ---
[functions]
  node_bundler = "esbuild"
  external_node_modules = ["openai"]

[build.environment]
  OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-..."
